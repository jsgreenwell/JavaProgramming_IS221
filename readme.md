### IntelliJ Course for Intro Programming
This contains a full gradle project used with 
the new education (course building) format IntelliJ
added.

It's for an Intro to Programming Class's Assignments 
and contains none of the actual lectures just the 
JUnit tests and Tasks.

Used to provide practice with the common interview/testing
style used in industry (typically with HackerRank or LeetCode)
and to give students immediate feedback.
