## First Lesson
This just checks to see everything 
is running for you in our learning 
environment and IDE. All you'll do 
is print "Hello, World!".

Once you complete that - upload the 
Task.java file to Moodle for grading.
You'll know if you passed or not 
because you'll get a green checkmark 
with Correct if it passes its tests.

Check the hint too (I'll add these occasionally):
<div class="hint">
If it fails, make sure to hit the "Show Full Feedback" link 
at the bottom to see any error messages 
(over searching for them).

</div>
