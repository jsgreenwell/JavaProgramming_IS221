### Complete the following tasks
You can assume the Date is the Due Date:
Sunday, February 4, 2024 11:59 PM

1. Add 4 variables 
    - dayName which holds the current day ("Friday", "Monday", etc.)
    - dayNumber which holds the current day (18, 19, 20, etc.)
    - month which holds the current month ("January")
    - year which holds the current year
2. Display the variables in a single format for testing then comment out the line
    - The format is "Month: July; Day: Thursday; Day No.: 18; Year: 2019"
3. Modify the program by adding 3 new variables:
    - hour (holds the hour 1-12)
    - minutes (holds the string of the minutes 00-59)
      - string? 0 is just 0 and we want "00"
    - timeOfDay (holds either "AM" or "PM")
4. Print the variables out in two formats:
    - Print a heading for US ("USA Format: ") and the date in US format 
    - Then print a heading for the UK ("UK Format: ") and the date in their format.
5. Turn in the .java file

### Expected Output
```
USA Format: Sunday, February 4, 2024: 11:59 PM 
UK Format: Sunday, 4 February 2024 11:59 PM
```

Note: UK format changes day & month, no comma, 
and no colon before time.
